**TiCaM Synthectic Images: A Time-of-Flight In-Car Cabin Monitoring Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and monocular depth estimation tasks. It is used in the safety and automotive industries. 

The dataset consists of 9918 images with 64191 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *person*, *infant seat*, *child seat*, and other: *infant*, *child*, and *everyday object*.

Images in the TiCaM: Synthetic Images dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *train* (9918 images). Additionally, images are grouped by ***im id***. Also every image contains information about its ***left seat***, ***right seat***. Images labels have ***position*** tag. Explore it in supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2021 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Germany Research Center for Artificial Intelligence</span>.
