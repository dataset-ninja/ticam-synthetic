**TICaM Synthetic: A Time-of-flight In-car Cabin Monitoring Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the safety industry. 

The dataset consists of 9918 images with 64191 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *Person*, *Infant Seat*, *Child Seat*, and other: *Infant*, *Child*, and *Everyday Object*.

Images in the TiCaM Synthetic dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *train* (9918 images). Additionally, images are grouped by ***im id***. Also every image contains information about its ***left seat***, ***right seat***. Explore it in supervisely labeling tool. Images labels have ***position*** tag. The dataset was released in 2021 by the Germany Research Center for Artificial Intelligence.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
